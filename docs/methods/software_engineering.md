# Software Engineering

Software Engineering is usually cheaper in the long run than coding the program by yourself like a personal programming project because the costs of changing a already launched software are way higher than adjustments during the development process.

There are two different types of software which are **generic products** (build to stock) like Photoshop, Microsoft Office or CAD. On the other side there are **customized products** which are build to order like a traffic control system for an airport or a taxing software.

Challenges of software engineering are the increasing diversity and demands for reduced delivery times and trustworthy software quality. To create software, there are different kind of techniques and methods available. You have to find the methods which suits your customers needs the best.

## What is good software?
From the customer view:
- **Correctness:** meets all specifications
- **Usability:** user-friendly and less effort to learn how to use it
- **Integrity:** doesn't have side-effects which affect other applications
- **Reliability:** no defects and failures
- **Efficiency:** use the available resources efficiently
- **Security:** keep data secure from external threats

From the programmers view:
- **Maintainability:** should be easy to maintain
- **Flexibility:** changes should be easy to make
- **Extensibility:** easily implement new features
- **Scalability:** easily upgrade it for more work or users
- **Testability:** very easy to test
- **Modularity:** build small units which are independent

From the business analysts view:
- **Interoperability:** exchange information with other applications
- **Reusability:** use the same code with light modifications for similar applications
- **Portability:** use software across several platforms and environments


## Definition of "Software Engineering"
- Covers all stages of software production from specification to maintaining the system after launch.
- covers all aspects of software production
    - coding
    - project management
    - development of tools to support production


## Software Engineering Process

There exists many different processes to create quality software, but all of them contain at least the following activities:

- *analysis and specification*
    - software is defined by customers and engineers
- *development*
    - software is designed and programmed
- *validation*
    - software is checked to ensure it's what customer requires
- *evolution*
    - software is modified to adapt changing customer or market requirements

There are plan-driven processes where all activities are planned in advance and it's easy to check the progress with the given plan. On the other hand there is the agile process where planning is incremental and it's easier to adapt to changing customer requirements. In practice, most SE approaches combine both of these methods.

## Software costs
About 60% of the costs are for the development, 40% for testing. The most relevant cost factors are:
- refactoring
- changes after release (expensive!)
- development team (hire / fire)
