# Waterfall model

The Waterfall model is a basic plan-driven SE process where each phase can only be started if the previous one is
finished. For the newer software developers it seems to be outdated but plan-driven models are still commonly used
and may be combined with agile processes.

### Advantages
- Clear differentiation between each phase
- Easy to plan and control
- Very efficient if requirements and costs are well-known

### Disadvantages
- Strict differentiation between two phases is mostly not possible
- Inflexibility in workflow changes
- Release only at the very long end of the process
- Design bugs may be recognized too late
