# Scrum

Scrum is the most famous agile SE process model. According to Extreme Programming, the Scrum sprints are slightly
longer 2 - 4 weeks) and Scrum is not that flexible like XP. Once the sprint has started it's impossible to change
the targeted content you want to realize. Scrum is mostly based on 3 Roles, 5 Activities (not called Meetings because
it's work) and 3 Artifacts. It can be combined with other elements like Planning Poker or a Kanban board to get a
maximum benefit out of Scrum.

### Advantages
- Effective use of time and money
- Large projects are divided into easily manageable sprints
- Team gets clear visibility through meetings
- Feedback from Stakeholders (advantage of agile)
- Good visibility of the task progress through daily scrums
- Developers don't need to use the feature priorities given by the product owner
- Better team morale through self-management
- Reduced risk of failing because of monthly product increments

### Disadvantages
- Lead developers may have problems that Scrum treats all developers the same
- End is not clearly visible for the management (not like waterfall model)
- Chances of failure are high if individuals aren't very cooperative
- Adopting Scrum in large teams is challenging
- Daily meetings may be frustrating at some point
- Huge negative impact if a team member leaves before the end of the project
