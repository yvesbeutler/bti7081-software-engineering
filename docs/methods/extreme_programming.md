# Extreme Programming

Extreme programming is an agile SE process model which is highly flexible to changing customer requirements during
the development process. You can even change the content of an iteration in the current iteration itself. Its
functionality is based on the different time units of all generic software projects.

| Time unit | Principles              | Description                                                                                       |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Seconds   | Pair Programming        | Improves code quality through constant feedback and controlling                                   |
| Minutes   | Test-driven development | Write tests before implementation to get 100% code coverage                                       |
| Hours     | Continuous integration  | Deploy new features instant to prevent future errors according to your changes                    |
| Days      | Standup                 | Organize a daily standup meeting to exchange knowledge                                            |
| Weeks     | User Stories            | Define the customers requirements in stories to give the developers clear instructions what to do |
| Months    | Release cycles          | Define release cycles and determine which major topics you want to handle in the next cycle       |

### Advantages
- Flexibility with dealing with changes
- Early releases can already generate incomes
- Better code quality through pair programming
- Changes can be tested and integrated immediately after creation
- Developers mood is bound to the project success

### Disadvantages
- May be inefficient with a lot of changing requirements
- Version control is necessary because of the iterations
- Higher costs because of pair programming
- XP needs brave developers who are self-organized and communicative
- Developer cannot change the order of the features given by the customer
- You have to use engineering practices like pair programming and TDD
